# GILD

This is ancient history, and never was meant for doing anything practical; it's essentially
a joke. Its practical use - when it had any practical use - was to experiment with new 
protocols.

The fact that protocols can be implemented in more or less any language you like is an added
jape: see HTTP in under 100 lines of shell script.

Enjoy!
